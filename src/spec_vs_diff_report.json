  "summary": "REQ-23 is only partially addressed: the header <img> still points to the required asset path, but the diff does not show the static logo asset being updated to the uploaded logo. Additional unrequested edits were made to SiteHeader and to project metadata/summary files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Update the static asset at `frontend/public/assets/generated/pachavda-wordmark-logo.dim_800x300.png` so it visually matches the uploaded `download-1.webp` logo and is web-optimized, while keeping the same path reference.",
      "reason": "The diff shows only a TSX component change and metadata file changes; it does not include any modification to `frontend/public/assets/generated/pachavda-wordmark-logo.dim_800x300.png` or any asset pipeline step that would replace it with the uploaded logo.",

      "description": "Changed SiteHeader logo rendering attributes and sizing (e.g., `className` set to `h-16`, added explicit `width`/`height`, `loading=\"eager\"`, `decoding=\"async\"`).",
      "reason": "REQ-23 focuses on replacing the static asset while keeping the existing path; it does not request changes to header component markup/behavior beyond continuing to render the updated logo.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not ask for updates to project summaries/state files; it only requests replacing the header logo image asset.",
